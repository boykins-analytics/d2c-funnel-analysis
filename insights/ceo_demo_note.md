# CEO Demo Note – D2C Funnel Insights

## Context
This analysis was designed to give leadership a fast, clear view of where revenue is being lost in the D2C conversion funnel.

## Key Finding
The highest drop-off typically occurs during the checkout phase, especially when additional costs or complexity are introduced late in the process.

## Why This Matters
Even small improvements at the checkout stage can have a disproportionate impact on total revenue due to funnel compounding effects.

## Recommended Action
- Increase price transparency earlier in the funnel
- Reduce checkout steps where possible
- Test simplified checkout variants immediately

## How This Is Used
This dashboard and analysis are intended for quick decision-making:
- Identify the problem
- Test a solution the same day
- Measure impact within days, not quarters

# Conversion Findings

## Observation
A significant drop-off typically occurs during the checkout stage, especially when additional costs such as shipping or taxes are revealed late in the process.

## Hypothesis
Unexpected costs and a lack of transparency during checkout increase friction and reduce completion rates.

## Potential Impact
Improving cost transparency earlier in the funnel could increase overall conversion rates and reduce abandonment.

## Next Steps
- Test earlier price disclosure
- Simplify checkout steps
- Monitor conversion rate changes after implementation
